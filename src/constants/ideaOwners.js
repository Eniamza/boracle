The PrePreReg's data flow was rebuilt from the ground up to provide a better and more reliable service. Still to this day, it remains one of the most famous community projects for quickly building, saving and testing mock routines as well as a way to simulate and train freshers for the upcoming registration season.",

Afterwards the Connect CDN became a full suite of tools to keep uptodate with the newer patches of Connect SLMS and committed to deliver the most reliable course data to the community",
